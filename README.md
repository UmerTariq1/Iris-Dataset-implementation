# Iris-Dataset-implementation
Being a new student of machine learning, iris dataset classfication is my first complete project. This dataset has 150 instances and is used to classify 3 different types of irises. In this problem I used logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. I have also shown a direct relationship of test scores with the value of K for KNN algorithm. Cross validation is done to chose the best value of K and chose which model out of the 2 (KNN and Logistic regression) is better. Using KNN I reached a test accuracy of 97% while using logistic regression i reached 95% accuracy.
Libraries used: Scikit learn, Matplotlib and Numpy
